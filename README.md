# CS 370 Current-and-Emerging-Trends-in-CS

    Briefly explain the work that you did on this project: What code were you given? What code did you create yourself?
In this project, I was tasked with creating a model that played the Treasure Hunt maze game. This AI model would learn the maze and where the treasure was and attempted to beat the opponent to the treasure. I was given the code for the TreasureMaze.py and GameExprience.py files and most of the IPYNB file. I had to refactor the pseudocode given in the IPYNB file into actual code that set the model on a training path that got it to achieve a 100% win rate. 
    
    Connect your learning from throughout this course to the larger field of computer science:
    
        What do computer scientists do and why does it matter?
Computer scientists research and develop systems that make life easier for humans in all aspects of life. From making driving easier to improving the accuracy of medical equipment, Computer scientists develop and implement systems that improve the quality of life for all humans.

        How do I approach a problem as a computer scientist?
As a Computer Scientist, I approach problems with the desire to find the simplest solution that I can in order to speed up the development process and to make it easier to use for users. I approach the situation in a way that ensures that there are as few biases and ethical issues as possible.
        
        What are my ethical responsibilities to the end user and the organization?
My ethical responsibilities to the ende user are to ensure that they receive the same experience as everyone else who uses the system. Regardless of their race, gender, or ethinicity, it is my job to ensure that those factors do not play a part in the system that they wish to use to improve their quality of life.
